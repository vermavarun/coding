This query retrieves the name of customers from the customer table where the referee_id is either not equal to 2 or is null.

select name from customer: This part specifies that we want to select the name column from the customer table.
where referee_id != 2: This condition filters out customers whose referee_id is 2.
or referee_id is null: This condition includes customers whose referee_id is null.
Combining these conditions with or means that the query will return the names of customers who either do not have a referee_id of 2 or do not have a referee_id at all (i.e., it is null).
