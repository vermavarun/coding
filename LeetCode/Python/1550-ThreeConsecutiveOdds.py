Solution: https://leetcode.com/problems/three-consecutive-odds/submissions/1630979353/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-05-11
Approach:
1. Initialize a variable `size` to the length of the input list `arr`.
2. If the size is less than or equal to 2, return False since it's impossible to have three consecutive odd numbers.
3. Iterate through the list `arr` using a for loop, checking each triplet of consecutive elements.
4. For each triplet, check if all three elements are odd (i.e., not divisible by 2).
5. If a triplet of consecutive odd numbers is found, return True.
6. If the loop completes without finding any triplet, return False.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input list `arr`.
Space Complexity: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space.
