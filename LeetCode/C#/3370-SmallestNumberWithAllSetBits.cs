Approach: Bit Manipulation - Check for Numbers of Form (2^k - 1)
Tags: Bit Manipulation, Math, Brute Force
1) Start from the given number n and iterate upwards.
2) For each number, check if it has all bits set (form 2^k - 1).
3) Use bit trick: n & (n+1) == 0 to check if all bits are set.
4) Return the first number that satisfies this condition.
5) Numbers with all set bits: 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, 1023...

Time Complexity: O(m) where m is the difference between n and result
Space Complexity: O(1)
