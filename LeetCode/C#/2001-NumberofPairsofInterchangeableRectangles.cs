Solution:
1. We need to find the number of pairs of interchangeable rectangles.
2. Two rectangles are interchangeable if they have the same ratio of width to height.
3. So, we need to find the ratio of width to height for each rectangle and store it in a dictionary.
4. Then, we need to find the number of pairs of rectangles with the same ratio.
5. If the number of rectangles with the same ratio is n, then the number of pairs of rectangles with the same ratio is nC2 = (n*(n-1))/2.
6. We need to calculate the number of pairs of rectangles with the same ratio for all ratios and return the result.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
