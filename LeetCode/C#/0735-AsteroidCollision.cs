/*

Approach:
- Use a stack to keep track of the asteroids
- If the asteroid is positive, push it to the stack
- If the asteroid is negative, check if the stack is empty or the top of the stack is negative
    - If the stack is empty or the top of the stack is negative, push the asteroid to the stack
    - If the top of the stack is positive and the asteroid is negative, check if the top of the stack is smaller than the asteroid
        - If the top of the stack is smaller than the asteroid, pop the top of the stack
        - If the top of the stack is equal to the asteroid, pop the top of the stack
- Reverse the stack and return the result

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
