/*
Approach:
1) Initialize two pointers, slow and fast, and point them to the head of the linked list.
2) Traverse the linked list until the fast pointer reaches the end.
3) Move the slow pointer by one step and the fast pointer by two steps.
4) If the slow and fast pointers meet, then there is a cycle in the linked list.
5) If the fast pointer reaches the end of the linked list, then there is no cycle.
6) Return true if there is a cycle, else return false.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
