Solution: https://leetcode.com/problems/fruits-into-baskets-ii/solutions/7047747/simplest-solution-c-time-onm-space1-plea-gfdo/
Approach: Iteration with Greedy Matching
Tags: Array, Greedy, Simulation
1) Initialize counter for placed fruits.
2) Iterate through each fruit in the fruits array.
3) For each fruit, find the first basket that can accommodate it (fruit <= basket capacity).
4) If a suitable basket is found, place the fruit and mark basket as used (-1).
5) Count total placed fruits during the process.
6) Return the number of unplaced fruits (total fruits - placed fruits).

Time Complexity: O(n * m) where n = fruits.length, m = baskets.length
Space Complexity: O(1)
