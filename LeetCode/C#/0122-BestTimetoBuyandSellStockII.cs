/*

Approach:
1) Initialize left and right pointers to 0 and 1 respectively.
2) Iterate through the array until the right pointer reaches the end of the array.
3) If the price at the left pointer is less than the price at the right pointer, calculate the profit and update the profit.
4) Increment both pointers.
5) Return the profit.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
