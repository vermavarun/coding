/*
Approach:
- For n = 1, there is only 1 colored cell.
- For n > 1, there are 4 * n * (n - 1) / 2 colored cells.
- So, the total number of colored cells = 1 + 4 * n * (n - 1) / 2. because there is 1 colored cell for n = 1.
- 1 + 4*1 + 4*2 + 4*3 + ... + 4*(n-1) = 1 + 4 * (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n - 1) = 1 + 4 * n * (n - 1) / 2
- So, the total number of colored cells = 1 + 4 * n * (n - 1) / 2. Sum of n natural numbers = n * (n + 1) / 2. Here n = n - 1. So, the sum of n natural numbers = n * (n - 1) / 2.
- So, the total number of colored cells = 1 + 4 * n * (n - 1) / 2.
Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: O(1)
