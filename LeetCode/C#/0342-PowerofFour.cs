Solution: https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-four/solutions/7087932/simplest-solution-c-time-olog4-n-space1-x6b5f/
Approach: Divide by 4 until n becomes 1 or not divisible
Tags: Math, Iteration
1) If n is less than or equal to 0, it cannot be a power of four.
2) While n is greater than 1, check if n is divisible by 4.
3) If divisible, divide n by 4; otherwise, return false.
4) If n is reduced to 1, it is a power of four.

Time Complexity: O(logâ‚„ n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
