Solution: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/solutions/7027831/simplest-solution-c-time-olog-n-space1-p-0qor/
Approach: Modified Binary Search
Tags: Array, Binary Search, Divide and Conquer
1) Use binary search with left and right pointers.
2) Compare mid element with right element (never compare mid with left).
3) If nums[mid] > nums[right], minimum is in the right half.
4) Otherwise, minimum is at mid or in the left half.
5) Continue until left equals right, which points to the minimum.
6) Return the element at the converged position.

Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
