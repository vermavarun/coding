Solution: https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/solutions/7074870/simplest-solution-c-time-olog3-n-space1-ficms/
Approach: Iterative Division
Tags: Math, Iteration
1) If n is less than or equal to 0, it cannot be a power of three.
2) While n is divisible by 3, divide n by 3.
3) After the loop, if n is reduced to 1, it is a power of three.
4) Otherwise, it is not a power of three.

Time Complexity: O(logâ‚ƒ n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
