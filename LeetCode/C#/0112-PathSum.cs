/*
Approach:
1. If the root is null, return false.
2. Call the recursive function HasPathSumBelow with the root, targetSum, and currentSum as 0.
3. In the recursive function, if the node is null, return false.
4. Add the value of the current node to the currentSum.
5. If the node is a leaf node, check if the currentSum is equal to the targetSum. If yes, return true.
6. Otherwise, recursively call the function for the left and right children of the node.
7. Return the logical OR of the results from the left and right children.

Time Complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once.
Space Complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree. In the worst case, the height of the binary tree is O(n), so the space complexity is O(n).
