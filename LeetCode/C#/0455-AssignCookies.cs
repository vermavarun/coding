/*

Solution:
1. We need to find the number of content children.
2. We have to assign cookies to children such that each child gets at most one cookie.
3. We need to find the maximum number of content children.
4. We can sort the children and cookies in ascending order.
5. Then, we can iterate through the children and cookies.

Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
Space Complexity: O(1)
